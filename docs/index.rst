Welcome to PyRaDiSe's Documentation
===================================

PyRaDiSe (Python package for Radiotherapy-oriented and DICOM-based auto-Segmentation) is an open-source Python package
for building clinically applicable  radiotherapy-oriented auto-segmentation solutions. This package addresses two main
challenges of auto-segmentation in clinical radiotherapy: data handling and conversion from and to DICOM-RTSS. Besides a
radiotherapy-oriented data model and conversion capabilities, PyRaDiSe provides a profound set of extensible processing
filters for fast prototyping and development of clinically deployable auto-segmentation pipelines. Therefore, PyRaDiSe
is a highly flexible and extensible toolbox, allowing for narrowing the gap between data science and clinical
radiotherapy research and speeding up development cycles.



Main Features
=============
The main features of PyRaDiSe are data handling, conversion from and to DICOM-RTSS, and data processing,
including deep learning model inference. The intended use of PyRaDiSe in the radiotherapy environment is depicted in
