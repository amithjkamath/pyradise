    "# Tutorial: Container-based Inference Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The deployment of the auto-segmentation solution demonstrated in the [\"DL-Model Inference Pipeline\"](examples.inference.basic.ipynb) example is shown in this tutorial. Typically, the deployment of auto-segmentation solutions is a challenging task due to various reasons such as that the physician's PC does not have a [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit), Python can not be installed onto the target machine because access is restricted, no access to the machines in clinics for installation, and many more. In order to circumvent those challenges, the usage of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers is a nice solution. The advantage of using Docker is manifold and include that the Docker image can be build by the developer without requiring access to the target machine, and that versioning of the Docker images is a built-in feature that comes at no costs. For more details on Docker we refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).\n",

    "### Develop Standalone Auto-segmentation Solution\n",
    "In general, one should start the development on a local machine without considering Docker too much.\n",
    "The goal of this first step should be to have a robust auto-segmentation solution that implements all required functionality.\n",
    "Furthermore, the project should have a proper structure what will make dockerization straightforward later.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, one should start developing an auto-segmentation solution standalone because the failure-free functionality should have the first priority.\n",
