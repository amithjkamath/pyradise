    "# NIfTI to DICOM-RTSS Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we demonstrate the conversion from NIfTI to DICOM-RTSS using the example data provided (details see [Examples](examples.rst)). Because DICOM-RTSS files include references to the corresponding DICOM image series, these must be loaded in addition to the NIfTI files for conversion. However, PyRaDiSe provides all necessary functionality and automates many of the tasks, such that minimal effort is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started we want to emphasize that PyRaDiSe include a 2D-based and a 3D-based algorithm for DICOM-RTSS reconstruction. Both algorithms can reconstruct 3D DICOM-RTSS but follow either a 2D or a 3D approach what have different advantages. In experiments, we could demonstrate that the 2D algorithm is more robust and faster compared to its 3D counterpart. However, the resulting DICOM-RTSS often contains structures that contain step-like details. This behavior is predominantly observed when the algorithm is inappropriately parameterized or the data is viewed in on a plane different from the DICOM image slices used for reconstruction. For the 3D approach we observed in general a more natural appearance but a longer computation time and larger memory footprint. Thus, the choice of the conversion algorithm is task dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to emphasize that the example data contains skull segmentations that are delineated outside the image extent. Because a conversion from DICOM-RTSS to NIfTI is only possible within the extent of the image parts of the nose were removed during example preparation. However, this let us demonstrate the performance of the converters that do not fail if foreground segmentations touch the borders of the image volume.\n"

    "## Extractor Implementation\n",
    "Because the naming of NIfTI files is flexible and the files do not incorporate content-related metadata, PyRaDiSe requires the user to implement `Extractors` to retrieve information about the `Modality` of the `IntensityImages` or, in the case of `SegmentationImages` about the `Organ` depicted and the `Rater` who created the segmentations. The approach of using user-implemented `Extractors` allows for maximum flexibility because the necessary content-related information can be either retrieved from the file path of the corresponding file or by accessing a third-party information source such as a database or a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For implementation, one must inherit from the provided `Extractor` base classes that provide implemented examples and explanations. In general, each `Extractor` gets the file path of each NIfTI file that is found by the crawler. Based on the path, the user must implement the `extract` method such that the method returns the requested information or `None` if the image type does not fit the `Extractor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ModalityExtractor`, in contrast to the other `Extractor` types, possesses two `extract` methods, which are used separately for DICOM data and for discrete medical images (e.g., NIfTI). If the user exclusively works which DICOM or discrete image data, the other `extract` method may skip from implementation by returning None. However, both `extract` methods are required in this example because DICOM data and discrete image data must be processed."

    "## Conversion Procedure Construction\n",
    "In the following code block, a reference `Modality` is defined that identifies the DICOM image series that is used as a reference in the DICOM-RTSS. This is followed by the component instantiation for the crawling, selecting, loading, and writing procedures. Afterwards, a loop loads the NIfTI data based on the `SeriesInfo` entries of each subject. Within the same loop the corresponding DICOM image series are crawled and loaded such that all data for conversion is in memory. At this stage we demonstrate also the functionality of the `RTSSMetaData` class that is used to specify certain DICOM attributes in the DICOM-RTSS. However, the conversion can also be executed without a `RTSSMetaData` because it then copies the necessary DICOM attributes from the DICOM image series. The same behavior applies for the unspecified `RTSSMetaData` attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After preparing the data for conversion, the specific conversion procedure can be selected by the type of `RTSSConverterConfiguration` provided to the `SubjectToRTSSConverter`. When the conversion has finished, the data can be written to disk by the previously instantiated `DicomSeriesSubjectWriter`. In addition to writing just the DICOM-RTSS, the `DicomSeriesSubjectWriter` will also copy the DICOM image series based on the provided `SeriesInfo` entries. This feature is helpful in the radiotherapy context because the used DICOM image data should not be altered what can be guaranteed by copying the data from the source directory. Furthermore, the DICOM-RTSS requires the referenced DICOM image series to be available for loading the structures."
