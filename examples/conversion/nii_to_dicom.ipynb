Because DICOM-RTSS files are closely linked to the corresponding DICOM image series and include references to those, the conversion procedure is not as straightforward as it may be assumed. However, PyRaDiSe provides all necessary functionality and automates many of the tasks, such that the user requires minimal effort.\n",

    "## Extractor Implementation\n",
    "Because the naming of NIfTI files is flexible and does not incorporate content-related metadata, PyRaDiSe requires the user to implement `Extractors` to retrieve information about the `Modality` of the `IntensityImages` or, in the case of `SegmentationImages` about the `Organ` depicted and the `Rater` who created the segmentations. The approach of using user-implemented `Extractors` allows for maximum flexibility because the necessary content-related information can be either retrieved from the file path of the corresponding file or by looking into a third-party information source such as a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For implementation, one must inherit from the provided `Extractor` base classes that provide implemented examples and explanations. In general, each `Extractor` gets the file path of the NIfTI file for which the content-related information is requested. Based on this path, the user must implement the `extract` method such that the method returns the requested information or `None` if the image type does not fit the `Extractor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ModalityExtractor`, in contrast to other `Extractor` types, possesses two `extract` methods, which are separately used for DICOM data and discrete medical images. If the user exclusively works which DICOM or discrete image data, the other `extract` method may skip from implementation by returning None. However, both `extract` methods are required in this example because DICOM and discrete image data are processed."

    "## Conversion Procedure Construction\n",
    "In the following code section, one defines first a reference `Modality` used for identifying the reference DICOM image series. Then, several specific component instantiations follow this, establishing the functionality for crawling, loading, selecting `SeriesInfo` entries, and writing the newly generated DICOM-RTSS. After setting up these functional components, the NIfTI `Crawler` extracts subject-by-subject the necessary `SeriesInfo` entries using the antecedently implemented `Extractors`. Following the NIfTI crawling, the NIfTI data gets loaded using the `SubjectLoader`. After executing the crawling of the DICOM data and a selection process on the `SeriesInfo` for excluding the old DICOM-RTSS data, conversion of the NIfTI data takes place. Finally, the writing of the resulting DICOM-RTSS dataset is achieved using the `DicomSeriesSubjectWriter`'s functionality."
