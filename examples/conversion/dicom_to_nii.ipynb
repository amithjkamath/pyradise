    "# DICOM to NIfTI Conversion\n",
    "This example demonstrates the conversion capabilities of PyRaDiSe by converting DICOM data into NIfTI images using the example data provided (details see [Examples](examples.rst)). However, because the example data comprises two uni-modal DICOM images (i.e., a T1-weighted and a T2-weighted MR image) and the DICOM data only provides minimal information about the modality and the acquisition details, PyRaDiSe is not able to automatically deduce the modality such that it can discriminate between the two images. Resolving this issue requires either a manually adjusted modality configuration file or a user-implemented [ModalityExtractor](https://pyradise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pyradise.fileio.extraction.html#pyradise.fileio.extraction.ModalityExtractor). This example demonstrates both approaches so the reader can understand which approach best fits the current application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this issue only arises if the import data comprises at least two uni-modal images. If this is not the case, PyRaDiSe assigns the modality retrieved from the DICOM data to the corresponding images, and the user does not need to take any action."

After reorienting, each image is resampled to have an output size of 256, 256, 256 voxels with unit voxel spacing. In order to ensure that all images possess the same origin and orientation we use the centering_method `'reference'`.\n",

    "In contrast to the first approach, the modality details are extracted via a set of rules or by accessing a third-party database. Here we use a rule-based approach because the example data encodes the sequence name (i.e., `\"T1\"` and `\"T2\"`) in the series description (`SeriesDescription` attribute). In order to extract the necessary information, we implement the `extract_from_dicom` method of the `ModalityExtractor`. In our implementation, we first define a set of DICOM tags that should be read from each DICOM file. Those tags are specified in the DICOM standard and are easily retrievable by looking into the [DICOM Standard Browser](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods). After defining the necessary DICOM tags, the `ModalityExtractor` retrieves the requested DICOM attributes from the provided DICOM file specified via its path. Afterward, we implement rules to identify the modalities and return a corresponding `Modality` instance.\n",
